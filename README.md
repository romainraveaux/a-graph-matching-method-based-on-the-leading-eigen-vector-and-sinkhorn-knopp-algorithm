### A graph matching method based on the leading Eigen vector and Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm

Goals :

*   An introduction to Graph Matching.
*   The graph matching problem is defined
*   A relaxed version of the graph matching problem is defined
*   A solver based on the leading eigenvector is defined
*   The obtained solution is refined by adding node-to-node constraints thanks to the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm
*   An application to Letter matching is proposed.
*   Code in Python base Numpy and Matplotlib is proposed through a Jupyter Notebook.
